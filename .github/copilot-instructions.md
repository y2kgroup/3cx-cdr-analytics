## Project: 3CX CDR Web Application
A full-stack TypeScript application that ingests 3CX CDR data via TCP, stores it in MongoDB, and displays analytics through a React dashboard.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- 3CX CDR web application with Node.js TypeScript backend, React TypeScript frontend, MongoDB database, and Docker compose setup. Requirements are clear. -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	<!--
	✓ Created full-stack project structure with backend, frontend, and Docker configuration.
	✓ Backend: Node.js + TypeScript, Express, TCP socket for CDR ingestion, MongoDB
	✓ Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind, Recharts
	✓ Created all necessary configuration files, models, routes, services, and components
	-->

- [ ] Customize the Project
	<!--
	✓ Implemented 3CX CDR parser with TAB-delimited field parsing
	✓ Created MongoDB models for Call records and AppMeta
	✓ Built REST API endpoints for KPIs, area codes, calls, and settings
	✓ Created React dashboard with charts and KPI cards
	✓ Added Settings page with system status and 3CX configuration instructions
	-->

- [ ] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- No specific extensions required for this project -->

- [x] Compile the Project
	<!--
	✓ Installed all backend dependencies (Express, Mongoose, TypeScript, etc.)
	✓ Installed all frontend dependencies (React, Vite, Tailwind, Recharts)
	✓ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in both backend and frontend
	✓ Both projects now build successfully
	-->

- [x] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	✓ Created development server tasks for both backend and frontend
	✓ Backend running on http://localhost:8080 (API + CDR socket port 5432)
	✓ Frontend running on http://localhost:5173 
	✓ MongoDB task available (requires Docker installation)
	 -->

- [x] Launch the Project
	<!--
	✓ Both development servers are running successfully
	✓ Backend API server: http://localhost:8080 (CDR socket: 5432)
	✓ Frontend dashboard: http://localhost:5173
	✓ MongoDB required for full functionality (Docker command provided)
	 -->

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!--
	✓ README.md contains comprehensive setup and configuration instructions
	✓ DEVELOPMENT.md provides detailed development guide with sample data
	✓ 3CX configuration instructions included in Settings page
	✓ Project structure documented
	✓ API endpoints documented
	✓ Troubleshooting guide included
